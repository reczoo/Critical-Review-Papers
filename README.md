+ [Arxiv'2020] [FuxiCTR: An Open Benchmark for Click-Through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05794), by Jieming Zhu, Jinyang Liu, Shuai Yang, Qi Zhang, Xiuqiang He.
  > Argument: Many new models for CTR prediction do not perform as expected compared to some classic ones.
+ [Arxiv'2020] [Neural Collaborative Filtering vs. Matrix Factorization Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09683), by Steffen Rendle, Walid Krichene, Li Zhang, John Anderson.
  > Argument: MLP in NCF does not outperform inner products in MF as reported.
+ [Arxiv'2020] [Empirical Analysis of Session-Based Recommendation Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12781), by Malte Ludewig, Noemi Mauro, Sara Latifi, Dietmar Jannach.
  > Argument: The progress in terms of prediction accuracy that is achieved with neural methods is still limited. In most cases, our experiments show that simple heuristic methods based on nearest-neighbors schemes are preferable.
+ [Arxiv'2020] [A Troubling Analysis of Reproducibility and Progress in Recommender Systems Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07698), by Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema, Simone Boglio, Paolo Cremonesi, Dietmar Jannach.
+ [CIKM'2020] [Critically Examining the Claimed Value of Convolutions over User-Item Embedding Maps for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11893), by Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema, Federico Parroni, Paolo Cremonesi, Dietmar Jannach.
  > Argument: Convolutions over user-item embedding maps do not outperform traditional baselines as reported.
+ [SIGIR'2020] [How Useful are Reviews for Recommendation? A Critical Review and Potential Improvements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12210), by Noveen Sachdeva, Julian McAuley.
  > Argument: Whether reviews are helpful for recommendation is questionable. Some state-of-the-art methods fail to outperform existing baselines.
+ [RecSys'2019] [Are We Really Making Much Progress? A Worrying Analysis of Recent Neural Recommendation Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06902), by Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema, Paolo Cremonesi, Dietmar Jannach.
  > Argument: Many deep models, including CMN, MCRec, CVAE, CDL, NCF and MVAE, do not perform better than simple baselines such as MostPopular, KNN baselines and SLIM.
